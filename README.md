# doodle_classifier
This is a CNN modle which can predict doodles belonging to 5 classes (star, sun, moon, rainbow and cloud). I've made the CNN in keras and for deployment in the brower I used flask server. Front end stuffs are done by HTML, CSS, native JS and jQuery.  

This web app supports two modes to input a doodle.

  *i)* drawing on the canvas.
  
  *ii)* uploading a predrawn doodle.
